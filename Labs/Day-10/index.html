            Bluey is an inexhaustible six year-old Blue Heeler dog, who loves to play and turns everyday family life into extraordinary adventures, developing her imagination as well as her mental, physical and emotional resilience. Bluey is built around imaginative games, led by the titular six-year-old and her four-year-old sister Bingo. Dad Bandit and Mum Chilli are regularly roped in, with near-infinite patience for familiar wails of "play with us!" or "again!" The cartoon family of cattle dogs has earned Brisbane-based creators a Logie, an Emmy, and squeals of delight whenever the distinctive theme song floats across the loungeroom.
